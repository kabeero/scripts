stunnel by default does not check / require openssl keys

if you set verify to 2 or 3:
2: compare against a given CAfile (certificate authority)
3: compare against a given CAfile (locally installed certificate)

steps:
1) create CA file (regular key) on server: server_ca_{cert,key}.pem
2) create openssl key on server: server_{cert,key}.pem (stunnel: key=,cert=)
3) create openssl keys on client, create a certificate request: client.req
4) using server's CA certificate, process request and return: client_cert.pem
